            God bless Prison Break â€“ never knowingly un-ridiculous, the revived FOX series wrapped its fifth season with a totally outrageous finale.
            
            'Behind the Eyes' delivered two absurd plot twists and a happy ending for Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), but with fans still clamouring for more, was this really goodbye?
            
            Here's everything you need to know about the show's potential future, following its brief but blissful comeback.
            
            Prison Break season 6: Is it happening?
            In January 2018, FOX officially confirmed that it was "developing a new iteration" of Prison Break. "It's in very early stages of development," said entertainment president Michael Thorn. "But we're really excited about it."
            
            Speaking about the revival mini-series back in 2016, Sarah Wayne Callies (who plays Sara Tancredi) said: "This was pitched as, 'We're gonna do nine episodes, drop the mic and walk away' and I'm fine with that."
            
            But, even back then, her co-star Miller was more open to the possibility of bringing Prison Break back again: "There's always room for more, in my mind," he said. "As long as it's a story that's worth telling, as long as it feels justified and cool and edgy.
            
            "It has to be something that's not going to let the fans down, that's going to satisfy and surprise. I'm open to the conversation."
